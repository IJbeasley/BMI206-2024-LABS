## <span style="color: firebrick;">  Question 9. Repeat step 6. Are MS-associated genes more enriched in any controllability category? Interpret. </span>

### 9a. Repeat step 6: Map and color known MS and HT genes onto their respective first order nets. Interpret results.

#### Plot: MS first order net (from directed network), with known MS genes colored in red

![MS first order network, color MS genes](Q9_MS_Directed_Col_Known_Genes.png)

#### Plot: HT first order network, with known HT genes colored red

![HT first order network, color HT genes](Q9_HT_Directed_Col_Known_Genes.png)

### 9b. Are MS-associated genes more enriched in any controllability category? Interpret. 

The null hypothesis to test is: The number of controllable genes in the MS-associated first order network is consistent with random sampling of controllable genes from the full directed network. 

```{r q9}
# total number of nodes in the MS associated gene first order network
# this is k in the hypergeometric parameters
k = 546

# is the total number of controllable nodes in the network
# i.e. dispensible + indispensible
m = 3677 - 8 # is the number of unlabelled nodes

# n is the total number of nodes in the directed network
n = 6338- m

# then the value to test for is the number of controllable
# ms associated genes 
q = 317

phyper(k= k, 
       lower.tail = F, 
       m = m, 
       n = n, 
       q = q)
```

This p-value suggest that MS-associated genes are not enriched for controllable genes. This is unsurprising given the proportion of controllable genes out of the MS-associated genes (317/549 $\approx$ 58%) is very similar to the proportion of controllable gene in the entire directed network (3667/6338).
